AblTest is a simple agent to test a previously compiled abl.jar

BEFORE RUNNING
	In build.xml:
		Edit line 8 to point to your eclipse directory
			example for most windows users: <property name="ECLIPSE_HOME" value= "C:\Program Files (x86)\eclipse"/>
			
TO RUN
	The [Default] build is buildAblTest, which builds the TestEntity.abl agent and its Runner.
	buildAndRunAblTest does the buildAblTest and then immediately runs the agent
	Some of the build commands (those that reference the src directory) are kept for reference,
		as it looks like they were previously part of the head ABL directory.
	
	
BEWARE
	TestEntity.abl is hard-coded into the build.xml. Don't try to rename/remove it without renaming it there:
		<abl.compile path="src/TestEntity.abl"/>
	Runner.java is hard-coded into the build.xml. Don't try to rename/remove it without renaming it there:
		<java classname="runner.Runner" failonerror="true" fork="yes">
